These Perl Scripts show basic Perl syntax and common operations

I created them so that, in the event of a long hiatus from Perl-writing,
I could just glance at these to remind myself of syntax

Since the goal of these scripts was, primarily, to capture Perl syntax, they
tend to be longer than strictly necessary.

Some scripts (like renameFilesByRearrangingDate.pl ) were actually used for
non-didatic purposes.
